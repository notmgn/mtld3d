//! TSC-based timing helper.
//!
//! Compiles to a single `rdtsc` instruction on both PE targets (i386 and
//! `x86_64`), bypassing any Wine-side `QueryPerformanceCounter` translation.
//! Under Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon the instruction is trapped to the ARM
//! generic timer; cost stays near-native (~10–30 cycles). The `aarch64`
//! branch reads `CNTVCT_EL0` directly instead of going through Rosetta —
//! used by native host test/lint builds, and also by an `ARM64=1`-built
//! unix `.so` (FEX-based bottles, no Rosetta involved), where it's the
//! correct native counter rather than a substitute.
//!
//! Returns raw TSC cycles, not nanoseconds. TSC is invariant on Nehalem+
//! so a single runtime calibration against `Instant` yields a
//! process-lifetime Hz value. Under Rosetta the emulated ARM generic
//! timer is likewise fixed-frequency (~945 MHz in practice, NOT CPU
//! clock), which is why the calibration is runtime-determined instead of
//! hard-coded.
